# Contributing to Harness plugins for Backstage

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the project. Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ❤️

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js [Active LTS Release](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/) and yarn. We recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) install and manage Node versions.
- [`git`](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- A Harness account (trial account works too). [Get started](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup)

## Clone the repository

Fork the [harness/backstage-plugins](https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins) repository through the GitHub web interface.

Clone the forked repository from your profile to your local setup.

```
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/backstage-plugins
cd backstage-plugins
```

<details><summary>Click here if you prefer to use the SSH protocol</summary>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GITHUB_USERNAME/backstage-plugins
cd backstage-plugins
```
</details>

Add the `upstream` repository where you forked from.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins.git
```
> _Note: This also allows you to sync changes made in the original repository with the fork._

To update your local default branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```

Install the dependencies and start the project in development mode.

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Note: The repository contains a sample Backstage app and backend (in `packages/`) with all the Harness plugins installed. Any changes to the Harness plugins in `plugins/` will be instantly reflected in the Backstage app. This is only for development purposes. Customers are recommended to use the plugins by installing them from NPM in their own instance of Backstage app.

Now go to http://localhost:3000 and see your Backstage app running!

## Contributing to the CI/CD plugin

The [Harness CI/CD plugin](../plugins/harness-ci-cd/) is used by developers to see their latest builds and pipeline executions inside Backstage. Checkout the [README of the plugin](../plugins/harness-ci-cd/README.md) to understand how customers install the plugin.

In order to contribute to the plugin, you need to import a new Software entity inside the Backstage Software Catalog which is connected to a Harness project with at least one CI or CD pipeline.

<!-- TODO: Maybe a simpler Harness tutorial without K8S and delegates. -->

### Create a new or use an existing Harness pipeline

If you already have created Harness pipelines, you don't need to do anything.

You can watch this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTbgEVgljg4) to create a pipeline in minutes. In this video, you can see how to build a sample pipeline based on Go to help you get started quickly with using Harness CI!

### Create and import a new Backstage software entity

Once you have a Harness project and at least one pipeline with few executions, let's setup Backstage to view those executions. Use the sample [Backstage entity YAML](../examples/catalog-harness-cicd.yaml) to create a new `catalog-info.yaml`. You can create this new YAML file somewhere locally in your computer or remotely on places like GitHub.

In your new entity YAML, replace the `harness.io` annotations under `metadata.annotations` with the details about your project. Checkout the [README of the plugin](../plugins/harness-ci-cd/README.md) to know more about the annotations.

Once your software component YAML is ready, import it inside the Backstage app. There are two ways to do it.

**Option 1: Local entity YAML**

If you created your entity YAML locally, go to the `app-config.yaml` at the project root. Under `catalog.locations`, add a new entry.

```yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    # ... existing imports.
    - type: file
      target: /path/to/your/entity.yaml
```

Note that it is better to use an absolute path. If you are using a relative path like `../../entity.yaml`, keep in mind that the path is relative to the `packages/backend/` directory.

**Option 2: Remote entity YAML**

Open the `http://localhost:300/catalog-import` page in your Backstage app. You can also reach here by clicking `Create` on the left side bar and then clicking "Register Existing Component". Insert a link to your newly created entity YAML file e.g. https://github.com/harness/backstage-plugins/blob/main/examples/catalog-harness-cicd.yaml

## Explore the plugin

That's it! Once you have registered your entity, you should be able to find it on the Home page.

Open it and navigate to the CI/CD tab.

If you have setup the annotations to the Harness project correctly, you'll be able to see pipeline executions for the software component!

Now navigate to `plugins/harness-ci-cd` to make any code changes. The changes will be reflected in your browser. Once you have made the changes, raise a Pull Request on this repository!

If you are stuck anywhere and have a few questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us on the [Harness Community Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/harnesscommunity/shared_invite/zt-1k5lupmly-No89okNhRnhBSWQa1o69_Q).

## Submit a PR

1. Commit your changes with an informative but short commit message:

```bash
git add /path/to/changed/fileORfolder
$ git commit -m "Commit Message that reflect the changes you made."
```

2. Push the local developement branch to origin (your fork):
```bash
git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
```

3. In a browser, navigate to your forked repo and then click `Compare & Pull Request`. 
- Choose `compare across forks` under the `Compare changes` title. 
- Choose your repository and the new branch you pushed in the right drop-down list. - Confirm the branch name and changes.
- Edit the pull request template with all the necessary information about your blog.

4. Wait for reviews. You can also ask for reviews in the Slack [#community](https://harnesscommunity.slack.com/archives/C044SFFSXJB) channel.

5. After review and if the pull request looks good to the community, committers will merge it.

Happy contributing!
